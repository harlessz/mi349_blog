        <h2>All About Me!!!!</h2>
        <p>So I guess this is where I introduce myself huh? Honestly I've never been very good at introductions, I always feel
            like I share the wrong information or talk for too long - or not long enough, so this time I think I'll just shoot for 
            somewhere in the middle and call it good. My name is Zachary Harless (or Zach for short) and I am currently a senior
            studying Computational Data Science with a minor in Information Technology. Although my studies are very STEM-heavy, I 
            have also always had a special interest in business as well, thus pushing me to join a professional business fraternity
            on campus known as Phi Chi Theta. I have had a great a time on and off of campus these past four years (thanks covid!), but I 
            am even more excited to see what the world has in store post graduation, I have tons of hobbies that I have been waiting to pursue
            since I just don't have the time right now, some of which include:
            <ui>
                <li>Cooking</li>
                <li>Pick-Up sports (Specifically basketball)</li>
                <li>Learning a new insturment - Guitar? Drums?</li>
                <li>Traveling abroad</li>
                <li>Digital music mastering</li>
                <li>+ lots and lots more</li>
            </ui>
        </p>

        <p>I've done a bit of traveling already, but the world is so huge that there's countless places to visit that I haven't gotten
            the opportunity to go to yet, such as Australia, India, Sweden, South Korea, and South Africa, just to name a few
        </p>

        <p>Well I know I said I didn't want to make this too long and I feel like it's dragging on already, but thank you very
            much for visiting my blog and remember to keep coming back for new posts!! Maybe next time I won't post a work story!
